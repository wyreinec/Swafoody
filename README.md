# Swafoody

Swafoody is a smart app that can help you to scan the ingredients you have and give the recipe recommendations and the nutrient information with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Technology. Using this app, you also help the global goals in Sustainable Development Goals at the same time, which is responsible consumption and production. Choosing the right recipe based on your ingredients and helping the world's problem of wasting food. <br>

Future Targets : Swafoody uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for predicting and classification an object. So in the future we hope this application can scan any material foods object around the world. and can show any menu with classification or filter they want to cook. Our target is to help reduce wasting food and help people life more healthy. <br>

Product Excellence : Product advantages from Swafoody has a realtime object classification with Azure Artificial Intelligence + Machine learning that has high accuracy to help people maximizing food materials they have to reduce world problem which mean wasting food. <br>

Technology Instrument : We are using Azure Artificial Intelligence + Machine Learning to predict and classification object at one time scan. We are using Azure cognitive services with custom computer vision to store our datasets to improve accuracy and complete the datasets. Then after we are done to classification object, we are connected with 2 APIs. First one is nutrition API, this API can show any nutrition from each object user has scan. And the second is Menu API, which API can show any menu based on their food materials which he has scanned before. This API also shows nutritions from a whole menu he choosed. <br>
